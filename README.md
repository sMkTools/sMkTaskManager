# sMk Task Manager - 2025 Edition

Yet another Windows Task Manager, in wannabe sMk style.

## Repetitive Goal

So, there are probably more than a billion of existing Task Managers out there for Windows, and there have been around since forever, what makes this one any different? Nothing...

This Task Manager is a rework of my working and daily use one, which was coded in VB.net back in ~2005 with the inception of .NET Framework 2.0, then ported to .NET Framework 4.5. I still use it as my primary Task Manager and I made few to none adjustments to Windows 11.

The Goal with this new project is to, first and foremost, migrate it to .NET 7, and second to port it to C# and native code.

## Disclaimer

I'm in no way a experienced C# programmer, in fact, I'm a proud 15+ year VB/VB.net lover, and another 10+ years experienced on PHP, Perl, JS.
I started playing with C# since the early .NET stages, but never get used to it, even less proficient and efficient, so we will see how this goes, most likely you will see pieces of code that are UGLY for experienced C#/C++ programmers. If so, please apologize.

Also, like many other enthusiastic programmers, I made more than 100 different personal programs and tools to help in our everyday tasks, but 75% of them are halfway there, never finished, never published, so go figure... we will see if this project is the rule or the exception.
